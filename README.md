This project is to explain how to move data between Snowflake and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2), and vice-versa. It also covers moving data between Blob Storage and Snowflake using Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines, including necessary setup steps, authentication methods, and using a staging layer.
